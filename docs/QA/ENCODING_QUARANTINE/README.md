# Encoding Quarantine

Use this folder to stage suspect files instead of overwriting live docs.

- Quarantine path: `docs/QA/ENCODING_QUARANTINE/YYYYMMDD/`
- Never overwrite canonical docs with garbled content; park suspect files here, note source and symptoms, and restore from clean source (GitHub/raw).
- Document what was quarantined and next steps before merging back.
